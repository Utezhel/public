## Sortable

### Instructions

You are a villain and your dream is to end with those annoying, yoga pants,
weird masks wearing superheroes. You never understood why are some of them
considered superheroes just because they are rich. Others annoy you with their
philosophical speeches. And of course that something tragic has had to happen
to them for the people to feel sorry for them. Anyway, we've found confidential
information about those superheroes.

Your task for the moment is to build a web page in order to organize all the
data from those smartypants. This information can be found [here](https://ogordoo.github.io/flatHeroAPI/superheroAPI.json).

- All the data must be contained in a table
  - Images should be shown too, as images and not as a string.
- The information must be displayed in multiple pages displaying from 10, 20,
  50, 100 or all results
- It must be possible to sort all columns of the table (either alphabetically
  or numerically)2
  - If you sort more than once, it should display the results in
    ascending/descending order

### Optional

Optionally you can make a search filtering system to be easier to pick your
next target.

With the searching system it must be possible to filter information by
searching by a string (ex: superheroes that contain `bomb` in their name).

- It must be possible to search also for the opposite of a string (ex: superheroes
  that didn't born in USA)
- This search engine must be available for all fields
